    +titledSection("Overview")
        p I was contracted by Resonant Games to build a real-time video chat platform, #[a(href="https://togetheroo.com/") Togetheroo]. The mission was to create a platform that connects family members over long distance. While video chatting, users can open a shared play space to play kid-friendly games and other educational apps. The current application library includes a collaborative drawing application and a mix-and-match smoothie game. See Bart Yeary's (of Resonant Games) demo and introduction videos below.

        p The project is under development, but you can open up a play space #[a(href="https://togetheroo.com/playspace/") here] and invite a friend.

        p The platform is built using real-time communication technologies â€“ #[a(href="https://firebase.google.com/") Firebase] and #[a(href="https://tokbox.com/") OpenTok]. The applications were built with #[a(href="https://p5js.org/") p5.js] and #[a(href="http://phaser.io/") Phaser].
