    +titledSection("Overview")
        p I taught a "Game Making in Unity" elective for Uptake's internal company university. The one day class was a crash course introduction to working in 3D with a popular, cross-platform game engine called #[a(href="https://unity3d.com/") Unity]. The class was beginner-friendly and assumed no prior experience. By the end of the elective, participants built their own first-person exploration games.

        p Topics covered: 3D objects, materials, lights, physics, using C# to detect interactions, spatial audio, post-processing and particles.
