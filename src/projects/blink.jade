        p Blink is an experimental game that puts the player into a body in a forest clearing. The only thing they can do is look around and try to figure out what is happening.
        p The piece was shown during the 2013 Basement Dwellers show at the School of the Art Institute. A downloadable version of the game is available <a href="//gamejolt.com/games/blink/18933">here</a>. 
        p &ldquo;So you get every illusion of logical connection, but the actual fact is that the thoughts become more and more cockeyed until theyâ€™re completely disjointed, and beyond that, you fall asleep.&rdquo; &mdash; Richard Feynman
