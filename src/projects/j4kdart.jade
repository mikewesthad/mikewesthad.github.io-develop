        p This work is currently in-progress. I am building a cross-platform mobile app for #[a(href="http://g3tj4kd.com/home.html") J4Kd] that combines abstract designs with 360Â° photography. The phone acts as a window into an altered reality. A viewer can move & rotate their phone to explore the space.
