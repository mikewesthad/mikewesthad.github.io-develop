                p Hi, I'm Mike Hadley.
                p I'm a #[a(href="/work.html?category=development" data-internal-link) developer], #[a(href="/work.html?category=teaching" data-internal-link) educator] and #[a(href="/work.html?category=art" data-internal-link) artist] who translates creative ideas into code and teaches others how to do the same. My mission is to make the world of technology more accessible â€“ both in terms of who has access to learning materials as well as through introducing people to the creative side of technology.
                p Have a creative vision that you want to bring to life? Get in touch and let's #[a(href="/contact.html" data-internal-link) chat].
